# PVP Revolution (WIP)

This plugin for CraftBukkit implements PVP the way we found fun on the "Whybrow" Minecraft servers. Lets go over what it's about:

## Strongholds

Permanently shield your most critical land from destruction using your **stronghold field**. Enemies may still switch entities, open chests, and even kill you, but your structures are protected from harm, fire and explosion. To help protect your property _PVPRev_ provides **stronghold upgrades** which can only be build within the grounds:

* **Inauguration booth**: Allow friends to live/build in your stronghold by having them step inside this pod.
* **Authority blocks**: Protect your stronghold from looters, limiting access to chests/doors/switches/etc. to you and your friends only.
* **Guard blocks**: Enlist mobs to help defend walls. Choose the Skeleton, Zombie, Pigman, or Wolf to stand firm in the face of intruders, and attack known enemies on sight!
* **Signal blocks**: Netrual visitors become enemies when they attack your stronghold, steel an item or stumble over a one of these traps.
* All additions integrate with redstone where possible.

## Wilderness

Outside of your stronghold it's more vanila Minecraft with PVP turned on. Travel with friends to gain XP bonuses when killing mobs. Make friends with new players to gain an instant XP reward.

The creation of, and each improvement to, your stronghold is performed naturally in game using gold and silver blocks in combination with others to build each upgrade.
